I'm Johannes, an Assistant Professor in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu). My research interests include optimization under uncertainty and optimal control of uncertain systems. My work has focused on the algorithmic development and the analysis of stochastic optimization problems governed by partial differential equations. Prior to joining ISyE, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich. I received my doctoral degree in Applied Mathematics from the same univerity in 2021.
